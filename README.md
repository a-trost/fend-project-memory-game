## Description

A matching memory game! Challenge yourself or use hints the entire time. The choice is yours!

## Game Play Instructions

To get started, first head to https://github.com/a-trost/memory-game to load the game.

Then click "Deal Cards." As soon as you do, you're on the clock, so start clicking! You're trying to match all the cards in as few moves and little time as possible, so you'll want to work fast and accurately.

You earn a star for finishing quickly, and another star for keeping your move count low. If you play an excellent game, you'll earn 3 stars. The worst you can do is 1 star.

## Contributing

Not really taking contributions, as it's a game made for a course at Udacity, just to test my own skills.
